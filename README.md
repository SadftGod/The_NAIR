 # __THE NAIR__ 
**<sub> new artificial intelegense reality </sub>**

## Introducion 

This project was designed to be your friend and assistant in daily life, which is why we decided to build the backend using a gRPC architecture for easy access from any device. I will enable a CORS policy to prevent careless use of the service or models. Along with this file, I recommend reviewing the <span style="color:cyan;">README_MODELS</span> to better understand the model itself‚Äîand perhaps your future best friend and assistant

I also plan to use a microservices architecture for the database to ensure resilience against failures and security breaches.

I intend to continue working on this project because I chose it for a reason‚Äîthe idea of having a friend who is always by your side resonates not only with me but with others as well.

## Set up

To start the project, all you need to do is run the command:

> python start.py

If this doesn't work, manually install the dependencies using:

>pip install -r requirements.txt

**<sub> Please note that this code must be run within a Python virtual environment (venv) named venvire and be sure that you have already installed python compiller </sub>**

## üîí Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Virtual environment named `venvire`
- Ensure `python` and `pip` are available in your shell

* if u don't create envire, run the script twice
